#CSS Points To Remember
1) min-height property defines the minimum height of an element. It prevents the value of the height property from becoming smaller than min-height.
2) The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items. Can be used only when flex is used. Direction depends on the direction of flex.
3) height: 100vh will be the 100% height of whatever the device is. % is the portion of the container the element is held inside of so height:100% will be the height of the container.
4) antialiased - Smooth the font on the level of the pixel, as opposed to the subpixel. Switching from subpixel rendering to anti-aliasing for light text on dark backgrounds makes it look lighter.
5) If we add bg to child, the rounded property of parent does not work and we need to seperately apply rounded property to child element.
6) The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis.
